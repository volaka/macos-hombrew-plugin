# BrewNotifier

A macOS menu bar app that tracks outdated Homebrew packages and lets you upgrade them without leaving the menu bar.

## Features

- **Badge count** on the menu bar icon showing how many packages have updates
- **Package list** with formulae and casks grouped separately, showing installed → latest version
- **Search** to filter packages by name — filters live as you type
- **Check Now** — opens a popup with live `brew outdated` output and a summary when done
- **Upgrade individual packages** — click any package to open an upgrade popup with live `brew upgrade` output
- **Update All** — runs `brew upgrade` with live output in a popup
- **Auto-refresh** — after any upgrade completes, the outdated list is automatically refreshed
- **Scheduled checks** — interval-based (every N minutes) or daily at a configured hour
- **Ignored packages** — exclude packages from the outdated list via Settings

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed
